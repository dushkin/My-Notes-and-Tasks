/**
 * Shared fixtures for Playwright tests that utilise the page object model (POM).

 * This file defines extended test fixtures that automatically provide
 * instances of page objects for the tree editing and content editing
 * interfaces.  Each fixture will navigate to the application root
 * before yielding, ensuring a consistent starting state for every
 * test.  Import these fixtures in your spec files instead of
 * '@playwright/test' directly to gain access to the `tree` and
 * `notes` objects.

 * Extend Playwright's builtâ€‘in fixtures with our own page objects.
 *
 * The `tree` fixture constructs a TreePage and calls its goto()
 * method so that the page is ready for interaction when the test
 * begins.  Similarly, the `notes` fixture constructs a NoteTaskPage
 * and navigates to the root.  Both fixtures depend only on
 * Playwright's `page` fixture and will be recreated for every test,
 * providing isolation between test cases.
